        y2d file1.yaml file2.yaml

    - Generate Anki decks from directories:

        y2d dir1 dir2

INSTALL
    To install 'y2d', you can use pip. Make sure you have pip3 installed, and 
    then run the following command:

        pip3 install -e git+https://git.sr.ht/~nzv/y2d

YAML STRUCTURE
    The tool requires YAML files to adhere to a specific format. Here's the expected structure 
    for your flashcard decks:

    - id: A unique identifier for your deck.
    - metadata:
      - name: The title or name of your deck.
      - description: A concise deck description.
    - cards: An array of individual flashcard entries.

    Each flashcard entry consists of the following elements:

    - card: Choose the type of flashcard (e.g., Basic, Cloze, or Prompt).
    - metadata:
      - title: Flashcard title or heading.
      - resource (optional): Include a link to related content.
      - tags (optional): Use tags for easy categorization.
    - spec:
      - front: Shows content on the front side (typically a question) with support for markdown syntax.
      - back: Displays content on the back side (providing the answer or additional details) with markdown syntax support.

    Here's an example of the YAML structure for a basic card:

        id: 637500
        metadata:
          name: My Deck
          description: A deck of sample flashcards
        cards:
          - card: Basic
            metadata:
              title: Sample Card 1
              resource: https://example.com/resource1
              tags:
                - Tag1
                - Tag2
            spec:
              front: Front of the card
              back: Back of the card
          # Add more cards here...
